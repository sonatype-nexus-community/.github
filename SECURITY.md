# Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

## When to report

First check [important advisories of known security vulnerabilities in Sonatype products](https://support.sonatype.com/hc/en-us/sections/203012668-Security-Advisories) to see if this has been previously reported.

Duplicate reports for the same vulnerability will be deleted.

## How to report

Sonatype utilizes the HackerOne platform for the Bug Bounty Program. If you do not have an HackerOne account, please send an email to [security@sonatype.com](mailto:security@sonatype.com) to receive an invitation.

See [https://www.sonatype.com/report-a-security-vulnerability](https://www.sonatype.com/report-a-security-vulnerability).

Prior to reporting, please review the program's policy for SLAs, program rules, in and out of scope vulnerabilities/applications, and bounty eligibility.
